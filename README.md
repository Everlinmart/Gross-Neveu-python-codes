# Gross-Neveu-python-codes
A Mathematica implementation of the Gross-Neveu model, focusing on thermodynamic quantities such as the effective potential, density, interaction energy, and critical chemical potential.




## **Features**
- Computes integrals for **Xp, Yp, and Wp**, essential for the model's thermodynamics.
- Defines the **effective potential** \( V_{\text{eff}} \) for different temperature and chemical potential conditions.
- Finds the **mean-field values** for \( \sigma \) and \( \eta \).
- Computes the **critical chemical potential** \( \mu_{\text{crit}} \).
- Generates **interaction energy plots** over a temperature range.

## **Usage**
Run the Mathematica notebook or script to:
- Compute various physical quantities in the Gross-Neveu model.
- Analyze phase transitions and interactions at finite temperature.
- Visualize the results with plots.

## **Dependencies**
- **Wolfram Mathematica** (any modern version should work).
